Well, it depends on what you semantically define as words. Since it is you who's writing the word count program, you are supposed to know what a word is.

So to test this program, you have to think where are the corner cases: does a "linked-word" count as one or two words? Do you consider "I'm" to be one or two? Etc..

As for the K&R exercise, I guess they voluntarily forgot some of these corner cases, and they suggest that you, analyzing their code, find these caveats.

Semantic definition of word, some special cases:

link word: "cat-walk"
small word: a, b,c
biiiiiig words: "a fooooooooo<40MILLIONLETTERS>ooooooo a" has 3 words
boundary conditions:

Texts with multiple spaces between words.
Texts bigger than 2GB
Words which contain a dash but no whitespace.
Non-ascii words.
Files in some different encoding (if your program supports that)
Characters which are surrounded by whitespace but do not contain any word characters (e.g. "hello - world")
Texts without any words
Texts with all words on a single line
